# Diablo3-model-exporter

Hi

To make the program work you need to add `casclib.dll` in the folder.

Open cmd

execute the exe with the following command line arguments `<diablo3 installation folder>` and `<app filename without .app>`
  
if you run it for the first time the program will map some id's to files and after doing so it will create the requested file.

when you run it without command line arguments it will try to run the program with my personal parameters which I use for lazy testing. There is a very slim chance that would work for your pc.
